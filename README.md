## Introduction

This project aims to construct an offline, interactive web application designed to facilitate real-time cross-correlation analysis of financial market data. The system provides a configurable interface to adjust analytical parameters, including rolling window size and asset selection, while dynamically generating visualizations that depict asset relationships over time. 

By integrating interactive dashboards with backend infrastructure, this system enhances analytical efficiency and data interpretation capabilities. The overarching goal is to create a flexible research tool that minimizes manual intervention, accelerates hypothesis testing, and improves the interpretability of financial correlations across different market regimes. Furthermore, incorporating optimized data processing techniques enables the handling of large-scale datasets without significant performance bottlenecks.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (User Interface)
**Technology**: React (JavaScript + Tachyons)

**Functionality**:
- Provides an interactive and responsive user interface for input configuration
- Renders real-time data visualizations through dynamic dashboards
- Establishes bidirectional communication with the backend via API calls
- Enhances user experience with interactive elements such as tooltips, sliders, and real-time data updates

### Backend (API & Computational Engine)
**Technology**: Flask (Python)

**Functionality**:
- Handles API requests from the frontend, enabling seamless user interaction
- Executes data ingestion, transformation, and statistical modeling
- Implements cross-correlation computations and performance optimizations
- Supports concurrent request handling to improve system responsiveness

### Data Processing & Feature Engineering
**Technology**: Pandas & Polars (Rust-accelerated DataFrame library)

**Functionality**:
- Loads and preprocesses large-scale financial datasets efficiently
- Performs rolling-window transformations, outlier detection, and statistical normalization
- Leverages Polars' optimized execution for computational efficiency

### Data Storage
**Technology**: CSV & Parquet

**Functionality**:
- Stores and retrieves historical financial datasets efficiently
- Utilizes Parquet for optimized compression and columnar storage
- Enables quick retrieval of specific data subsets

### Visualization & Analytical Dashboards
**Technology**: Plotly, D3.js or Recharts / Matplotlib & Seaborn

**Functionality**:
- Constructs interactive correlation matrices and time-series visualizations
- Provides statistical insights into asset interdependencies
- Enables real-time manipulation and exploratory data analysis
- Incorporates comparative analytics for correlation analysis
